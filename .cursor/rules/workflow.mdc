# Workflow Rules

## 1. Educate Before You Code
For any new tool, framework, or architecture pattern, ALWAYS lead with:
1. **What it is** — one precise sentence
2. **Why industry uses it** — name the naive alternative and why it falls short
3. **How it fits here** — tie it explicitly to Agrobot TOM v2's architecture

❌ BAD: Jump straight to `MODULE.bazel` without explaining what Bzlmod is.
✅ GOOD: "Bzlmod replaces WORKSPACE because it gives us reproducible, hermetic dependency resolution — WORKSPACE's `http_archive` fetches are not pinned by default and silently drift. Here is how we use it in this repo: ..."

## 2. One Step at a Time
Propose → explain → wait for approval → implement. Never generate the next task unprompted.

## 3. Agile Tracking
Use `todo_write` to maintain the sprint task list. Mark `in_progress` before starting; mark `completed` immediately after. Never leave a task in limbo.

## 4. Version Finalization — "Done" Means Three Things
A task is complete only when it produces all three:

| Part | What to Deliver |
|------|----------------|
| **Concept** | Why this approach? What does it replace and why is it better for this project? |
| **Implementation** | The code or config, with patterns matching this codebase |
| **Verification** | Exact command(s) to prove it works, labeled `[MAC]` / `[HPC]` / `[EDGE]` |

A version is NOT final if:
- The verification step is "it should work" with no runnable command
- The code doesn't match the codebase's established patterns
- Any `# Sprint N:` forward markers for this sprint remain unfilled
