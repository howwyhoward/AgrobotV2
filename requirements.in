# ─── Provided by ros:jazzy-ros-base via apt (DO NOT pip-install) ──────────────
# These are pre-installed by the ROS base Docker image as Debian packages.
# Pip cannot upgrade them inside the container (no RECORD file).
# They are listed here for IDE type-checking / local venv only.

#   numpy>=1.26          (apt: python3-numpy 1.26.4)
#   pyyaml>=6.0          (apt: python3-yaml 6.0.1)
#   pytest>=7.4          (apt: python3-pytest 7.4.4)
#   rclpy                (apt: ros-jazzy-rclpy)
#   opencv-contrib       (apt: ros-jazzy-vision-opencv)

# ─── Pip-only (NOT in ROS apt packages) ───────────────────────────────────────
# These are the packages we actually install via pip inside Docker.
#
# opencv-python-headless is intentionally excluded here:
#   ros-jazzy-vision-opencv (apt) already provides python3-opencv, and
#   the pip wheel pulls numpy>=2 which conflicts with Debian's numpy 1.26.4.
