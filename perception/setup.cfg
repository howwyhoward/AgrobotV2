# setup.cfg is REQUIRED by ament_python (ROS 2's Python build type).
#
# Why: colcon uses `pip install --editable` internally, which calls setuptools.
# setuptools places console_scripts (our `tomato_detector` entry point) into
# a `bin/` directory by default. But `ros2 run` looks for executables in
# `install/agrobot_perception/lib/agrobot_perception/` — a ROS 2 convention.
#
# These two lines redirect where setuptools installs scripts to match what
# `ros2 run agrobot_perception tomato_detector` expects to find.
#
# Without setup.cfg: colcon builds but `ros2 run` silently fails to find the node.
# With setup.cfg: `ros2 pkg executables agrobot_perception` shows `tomato_detector`.
